I grew up playing a bunch of games but the one I remember playing the most was Fruit Ninja [Halfbrick Studios](https://www.halfbrick.com/).
In honor of that game, I made a game about chopping vegetables.
This is just the initial release but I plan on adding levels with requirements of chopping specific vegetables in a certain amount of time.

To try out this game you can view the below.
